    <h1>Characters</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Pride and Prejudice</b> is set in rural England at the turn of the 19th century, and it follows the Bennet

        family, which includes five very different sisters. The eldest, Jane, is sweet-tempered and modest. She is her
        sister Elizabeth’s confidant and friend. Elizabeth, the heroine of the novel, is intelligent and high-spirited.
        She shares her father’s distaste for the conventional views of society as to the importance of wealth and rank.
        The third daughter, Mary, is plain, bookish, and pompous, while Lydia and Kitty, the two youngest, are flighty
        and immature.

        <b>Mr. Bennet</b> is the family patriarch. He is fond of his two eldest daughters—especially his favorite,
        Elizabeth—but takes a passive interest in the younger ones, ultimately failing to curb their childish instinc
        ts. An intelligent but eccentric and sarcastic man, he does not care for society’s conventions and mocks his
        wife’s obsession with finding suitable husbands for their daughters. As several scholars have noted, however,
        Mrs. Bennet is rightfully concerned. Because of an entail, the modest family estate is to be inherited by
        William Collins,<b> Mr. Bennet’s nephew,</b> who is the next male in line. Indeed, as Austen scholar Mary Evans
        noted, “If Mrs. Bennett is slightly crazy, then perhaps she is so because she perceives more clearly than her
        husband the possible fate of her five daughters if they do not marry.”<b> Unfortunately, Mrs. Bennet’s
        </b>fervor and indelicacy often work against her interests. A woman of little sense and much self-pity, she
        indulges her lively youngest daughters.
