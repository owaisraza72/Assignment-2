   <h1>Exploring the World of Literature</h1>
   <p>The impact of classic novels on literature is profound and enduring. Works such as <strong>Pride and
         Prejudice</strong> by Jane Austen not only entertain but also explore themes of <em>social class and
         relationships</em>. Similarly, <strong>1984</strong> by George Orwell introduces readers to the harrowing
      implications of totalitarianism, emphasizing the theme of <em>government control and individual freedom</em>.
      These novels, along with others, continue to shape literary discourse and inspire new generations of writers. </p>
